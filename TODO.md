# Portfolio Modifications Before Deployment

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Fix typos and inconsistencies in portfolio/html/index.html (e.g., IDs like "contat" to "contact", "abouty" to "about", duplicate classes)
- [x] Add contact form submission logic to portfolio/script.js (validation, prevent default, show toast messages)
- [ ] Test locally: Open index.html in browser to verify fixes and functionality
- [ ] Polish: Review for accessibility, responsiveness, and any broken links
- [ ] Prepare for deployment: Ensure ready for GitHub Pages or similar
